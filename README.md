# student-enrollment
using python dictionary: working with data on student enrollment in classes of the Boston School of Magic

The data includes
• A list of courses included in two certificate programs of the school (descriptions of programs provided in program1.txt and program2.txt)
• Course prerequisites structure (prereqs.txt)
• Class lists, including grades, for students who took these courses in the past as well as those who
are taking the courses now (2019-20). Each class list comes in a separate file, the first line of which includes the course number, preceded with letter ‘c’, e.g. c1250. Each such file stores records of students who were/are enrolled in course number 1250. (those files that contain -1 instead of a grade are current semester files, for which grades have not been posted yet.)
